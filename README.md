# caddy-pco-login
Custom build of caddy in Docker using the jwt and [modified] login plugins to support OAuth2 login with Planning Center Online (https://planning.center/)

Using the login and jwt caddy plugins, access to your site or specific pages can be controlled via your organization ID and Planning Center People permissions.

For now, see the Caddyfile as an example.
